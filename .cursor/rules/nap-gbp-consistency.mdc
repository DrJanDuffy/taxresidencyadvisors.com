# NAP & GBP Consistency

- **NAP** (name, address, phone) in visible text and in LocalBusiness JSON-LD must match the Google Business Profile exactly.
- Every page has or inherits appropriate schema (e.g. LocalBusiness); contact/location pages include hours, map, and Call / Directions / View Google Reviews.
- Before considering a page done, confirm NAP and schema are present and consistent with GBP.
