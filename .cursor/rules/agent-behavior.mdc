# Agent Behavior (Must Follow)

## Before making code changes

1. **Summarize** the task in one or two sentences.
2. **List assumptions** (e.g. which files, which approach).
3. **Propose a plan** (steps or a plan document) unless the user has already provided or approved a plan (e.g. "Implement the plan as specified").
4. **Wait for explicit confirmation** before editing—**except** when the user has already confirmed (e.g. "Implement the plan", "Do it", "Go ahead").

When the user says "implement the plan" or "execute the plan," the plan file is the approved scope; do not add or remove scope without asking.

## Build and validation

- **Production build validation** (e.g. after implementing features): use **Vercel CLI** — `vercel build` or `vercel --prod` when deploying. Do **not** use `npm run build` or `pnpm build` for production validation unless the user explicitly asks for a local build.
- **Local development**: `npm run dev` or `vercel dev` is fine.

## No destructive changes without approval

- **Do not delete files** unless the user or an approved plan explicitly asks for deletion.
- **Do not perform large refactors** (renaming many files, changing project structure, swapping libraries) without explicit user approval.
- If a plan says "do not edit the plan file," do not modify the plan file.

## After completing work

- After providing a summary of what was implemented, run **git add, commit, push** per the rule "After Summary: Git Add, Commit, Push" (concise commit message, push to remote). Skip if the user asked not to commit or there are no changes.
