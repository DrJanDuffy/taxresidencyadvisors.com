# After Summary: Git Add, Commit, Push

When you produce a **summary** of work done in the conversation (e.g. "Summary of what was implemented" or "Summary of changes" at the end of a task):

1. **Immediately after** that summary, run:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<short descriptive message>"`
   - `git push`

2. **Commit message**: Short and descriptive (e.g. "Add OG/Twitter metadata and dynamic OG image", "Docs: add Analytics section to README"). No need for a full changelog in the message.

3. **Skip** the git steps if the user asked not to commit, or if there are no changes—and say so in the summary.

This keeps the repo in sync with completed work whenever you summarize what was done.
