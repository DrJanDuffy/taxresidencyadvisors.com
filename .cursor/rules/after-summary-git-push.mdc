# After Summary: Git Add, Commit, Push

When you generate a **summary** of work done in the conversation (e.g. a "Summary of what was implemented" or "Summary of changes" at the end of a task):

1. **Immediately after** providing that summary, run:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<short descriptive message>"`
   - `git push`

2. Use a concise commit message that reflects the work summarized (e.g. "Add OG/Twitter metadata and dynamic OG image", "Docs: add Analytics section to README").

3. If the user has asked not to commit, or there are no changes, skip the git steps and say so in the summary.

This keeps the repo in sync with completed work whenever you summarize what was done.
