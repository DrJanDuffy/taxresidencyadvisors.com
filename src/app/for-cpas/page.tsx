            Your client is leaving California (or another high-tax state) for Nevada. The tax strategy is solid. But now they need to:

          <ul className="mt-6 list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-[var(--foreground)]/90">
            <li>Buy a home in Nevada that supports their domicile claim</li>

            <li>Get documentation that withstands an FTB audit</li>

            You can&apos;t do all of that AND manage their tax return. You need a real estate partner on the ground in Nevada who gets it.
